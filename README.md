# frostwood-chronicles
Frostwood Chronicles is a game prototype I built for my Mobile Game Development course at Athabasca University.


**INSTALLATION GUIDE**
Inside the source code folder is a folder titled Frostwood. Open this folder as a project within Android Studio. From here you should simply have to compile the code and it will run.

For replicating testing enviornment use the Pixel 4 API 30 emulator. Most phones should function though, as attempts were made to account for a variety of screen sizes.

**DETAILED STEPS**
- Open Android Studio
- Select File -> Open
- Traverse to your file system to the folder titled Frostwood within the source code folder and hit okay.
- Let the project load.
- Select Tools -> Device Manager
- Click Create device (should be near the top right now)
- Select the Pixel 4 and click next.
- Select R (API level should be 30) and click download next to the R.
- Complete installation.
- Next to the play symbol select the Pixel 4 and click play.
- The emulator should load the Pixel 4 and the game will launch on the emulated phone.
